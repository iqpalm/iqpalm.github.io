    <h1>Background</h1>
    <p>
      I have been working as a finance contractor for a number of years in
      different sectors.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think it is best if I start with my most recent experience first and
      then work backwards.
    </p>
    <h3>Closerstill Media Limited - Events company</h3>
    <p>
      I worked at Closerstill Media for 7 months. The company was transferring
      their finance system from Sage to Unit 4. I had previously worked with
      some of the employees at Wolseley.
    </p>
    <p>
      My first task was to reconcile the data from Sage to Unit4 ensuring that
      the overall numbers tied back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, I was required to learn Prevero and import data into this system
      ready for it to be used by the business for reporting purposes.
    </p>
    <h3>Halfords - Retail</h3>
    <p>
      I worked at Halfords for 10 months. I worked in their Operations Finance
      team. This team was responsible for reportng on the performance of stores.
    </p>
    <p>
      I designed and implemented new year-to-date reports that looked at trends.
      This enabled Operations to take a long-term view of performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also provided support to Operations with adhoc reports and in-depth
      analysis based on their requirements.
    </p>
    <h3>Wolseley - Retail</h3>
    <p>
      I worked at Wolseley for nearly 2 years. I worked in various roles in
      their Finance team.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was brought into the project team to develop Business Objects and
      Hyperion reports. These were part of the new company wide reporting suite.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then moved to develop a new commissions process together with new models
      and documentation.
    </p>
    <h3>National Grid - Utilities</h3>
    <p>
      I joined at a time when the distribution part of the business was being
      seperated
    </p>
    <p>
      My role was to document the current working processes and the systems that
      were being used
