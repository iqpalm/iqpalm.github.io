    <h1>Motivation for change</h1>
    <p>
      I have been working as a finance contractor for a number of years in
      different sectors.
    </p>
    <p>
    There were many reasons for attending the bootcamp and changing careers, some of these are listed below.
    </p>
    <h3>University</h3>
    <p>I have always been interested in IT from my A-level days.</p>
    <p>During universtity I undertook a combined honours degree split equally between Business and Computer Science</p>
    <p>The Computer Science part of my degree gave me an understanding of programming languages such as Ada</p>
    <p>However, for reasons unknown to me I decided to follow the business element of my degree into Finance</p>
    <p>The interest in IT however has always been there and I am eager to follow this and develop this interest into a career hence the enrolment on to the bootcamp</p>

    <h3>Change in career</h3>
    <p>
    I have been working as a contractor in various sectors, this has enabled me to experience different company cultures and working practices. </p>
    <p>The roles that I have undertaken have been dealing with data and taking this raw data and developing insights and reports for end users.</p>
    <p>I have been thinking for a while that I would like to further develop my skills and transition away from Finance but still help users achieve their requirements</p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Lockdown experience</h3>
    <p>
      Lockdown provided me with the opportuntity to test if I still enjoyed problem solving using code.</p>
    <p>I enrolled with Datacamp and started on their Python course</p>
    <p>I enjoyed learning something new and I was surprised how quickly I picked up the fundamentals once I got going</p>
    <h3>Conversations with my brother</h3>
    <p>
     My brother is a developer with the civil service and I had numerous conversations with him about changing careers</p>
     <p>He himself had changed careers be it through taking a IT masters but he explained that there was always something to learn and that no-one knows everything.</p>
     <p>I think it was this statement that made me finally decide to take the plunge and attend the bootcamp...<strong>as there is always something to learn:)</strong></p>
